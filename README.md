## Installing from source

The recommended way to install `pyCHomP2` is using `pip` as above. To get the bleeding edge version (i.e., this repo) install with the commands below. This requires a `C++` compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marciogameiro/pyCHomP2.git
cd pyCHomP2
pip install . --ignore-installed --no-cache-dir
